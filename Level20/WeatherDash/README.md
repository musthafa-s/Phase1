# WeatherDash

WeatherDash is a weather dashboard that shows current weather conditions and historical weather data for user-selected locations.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - React application (UI, charts, geolocation, etc.)
- `backend/` - Node.js REST API (weather data, caching, MongoDB, etc.)

Further setup instructions and requirements will be added after scaffolding both frontend and backend.
